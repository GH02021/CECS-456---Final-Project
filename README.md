I created this project inside my Google Colab folder inside of my Google Drive account. Additionally, my data takes the form of a zip file
that is also placed inside the Google Colab folder (I am unable to add it to this GitHub due to file size, so I will submit the zip file
on Canvas under the "Project Report" assignment). The data is medical images are categorized into one of six categories: AbdomenCT, 
BreastMRI, CXR (Chest X-Ray), ChestCT, Hand, & HeadCT.

It is necessary to:
  1. Change the path inside my code to fit your path to your Google Colab folder.
  2. Upload my zip file & .ipynb file to the Goolge Colab folder.
  3. Name the zip file (containing all data) "medical_data" unless you change the code to accomodate.

I created this project inside my Google Colab folder inside of my Google Drive account. Additionally, my data takes the form of a zip file
that is also placed inside the Google Colab folder (I am unable to add it to this GitHub due to file size, so I will submit the zip file
on Canvas under the "Project Report" assignment). 

It is necessary to:
  1. Change the path inside my code to fit your path to your Google Colab folder.
  2. Upload my zip file & .ipynb file to the Goolge Colab folder.
